Hello!

This is my attempt at creating a budget application using vanilla JavaScript. 

With this app, you'll be able to fill in your expenses and income. The app will then calculate the balance and display it. You can also delete and edit already created entries. There are three views to toggle from; 'expenses', 'income', and 'all'. 

The app also saves your data to your local storage so that you don't lose all your inputs if you accidentally refresh your page or close the browser.
